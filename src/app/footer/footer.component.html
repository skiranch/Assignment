           <h4> Welcome to QIC!</h4>
            
          <p> Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by QIC Property Holdings Pty Ltd("QIC", located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
            
            By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.
            
            Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.
            
            Using our Services</p>
            
           
            
            <p> Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
            
            Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.
            
            Our Services display some content that is not QIC’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.
            
            In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.
            
            Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.
            
            Your QIC Account</p>
            
            <p>You may need a QIC Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own QIC Account, or your QIC Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a QIC Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.
            
            To protect your QIC Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your QIC Account. Try not to reuse your QIC Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or QIC Account, follow these instructions.
            
            Privacy and Copyright Protection</p>
            
            <p>  QIC’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that QIC can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.
            
            We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
            
            We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and QIC’s policy about responding to notices in our Help Center.
            
            Your Content in our Services</p>
            
            <p> Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
            
            When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give QIC (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to QIC Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.
            
            Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.</p>
